AndroMedian
===========

This is android app named AndroMedian. It is a web app that is based on the website http://gscatmgiresources.github.io/android.html
This can be used as a template for making any web app on android. All you need to do is to change the loadUrl() parameter in MyActivity.java file, edit the about section using .xml file and You're good to go. 
P.S. You obviously also need to change project name, package name, appmanifest file etc. In short, copy...but use some own creativity.
In the end its open for all. I will be happy if anyone could improve it.
